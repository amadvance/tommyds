TommyDS HISTORY
===============

2.2 2018/02
===========
 * Removed tommy_list_remove_head_not_empty() as not used and wrongly
   implemented [Daniel Roethlisberger].

2.1 2016/11
===========
 * Added a new hash function for strings: tommy_strhash_u32().
 * Added a new tree implementation. It's not intended to be fast but useful if
   you need elements in order.
 * Fixed some references to TOMMY_ARRAYBLKOF_SIZE, where instead
   TOMMY_ARRAYBLK_SIZE was incorrectly used [Rocco].

2.0 2014/12
===========
 * Fixed a Segmentation Fault bug in the trie_inplace container when inserting
   duplicate elements.
 * Faster array and hashlin implementation when accessing elements.
 * Added new hashtable functions to iterate over all the elements.
 * Added a new tommy_calloc() function used for allocating initialized memory.
   If you redefined tommy_malloc(), likely you have to redefine also tommy_calloc().
 * Reached 100% code coverage in the regression test.      
 * Different source code organization.
 * Added benchmark comparison with Binary Search Tesseract by Gregorius van
   den Hoven.

1.8 2013/12
===========
 * Fixed build of tommy_arrayblk in C++.
 * Changed the default node size of tommy_trie to fit a cache line of 64 bytes.
 * Added benchmark comparison with STX BTree.

1.7 2013/12
===========
 * Extends tommy_hashlin_done() to work also if the hashtable is not empty.
 * Removes the empty tommy_trie_done() because the real deallocation is done
   by the allocator.

1.6 2013/11
===========
 * Added a new tommy_arrayblk and tommy_arrayblkof types to store elements
   in an array minimizing memory occupation.

1.5 2013/06
===========
 * Fixed inline declaration to allow building with clang.
 * Added a new tommy_arrayof type to store in an array elements of arbitrary
   size.

1.4 2013/03
===========
 * Added benchmark comparison with Google BTree, and C++ map and unordered_map.
 * Benchmark for Linux is now compiled with "-O3 -march=pentium4 -mtune=generic",
   and the Windows one with "/Ox /GL /GS- /arch:SSE2".

1.3 2013/02
===========
 * Fixed a Segmentation Fault bug in the hashlin container if exact power
   of 2 sizes were used.
 * Removed some warnings with newer gcc.
 * Minor documentation changes.
 * Added benchmark comparison with the judy array implementation by Karl Malbrain.

1.2 2012/05
===========
 * Minor documentation changes.
 * In the check application, added a speed comparison with the C qsort()
   implementation.

1.1 2012/05
===========
 * Fixed the tommy_hashdyn_remove() function. Now it shrinks the hashtable if required.
 * Minor documentation changes.

1.0 2011/03
===========
 * First official version of TommyDS.
 * Added tommy_list_foreach functions.

0.2 2011/03
===========
 * Added tommy_array. A dynamic vector.

0.1 2011/01
===========
 * First release of Tommy.
