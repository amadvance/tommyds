/** \file
 * Inplace trie.
 *
 * This trie is a inplace implementation not needing any external allocation.
 *
 * Elements are not stored in order, like ::tommy_trie, because some elements
 * should be used to represent the inner nodes in the trie.
 *
 * You can control the number of branches of each node using the ::TOMMY_TRIE_INPLACE_TREE_MAX define.
 * More branches imply more speed, but a bigger memory occupation.
 *
 * Compared to ::tommy_trie you should use a lower number of branches to limit the unused memory
 * occupation of the leaf nodes. This imply a lower speed, but without the need of an external allocator.
 *
 * To initialize the trie you have to call tommy_trie_inplace_init().
 *
 * \code
 * tommy_trie_inplace trie_inplace;
 *
 * tommy_trie_inplace_init(&trie_inplace);
 * \endcode
 *
 * To insert elements in the trie you have to call tommy_trie_inplace_insert() for
 * each element.
 * In the insertion call you have to specify the address of the node, the
 * address of the object, and the key value to use.
 * The address of the object is used to initialize the tommy_node::data field
 * of the node, and the key to initialize the tommy_node::key field.
 *
 * \code
 * struct object {
 *     int value;
 *     // other fields
 *     tommy_node node;
 * };
 *
 * struct object* obj = malloc(sizeof(struct object)); // creates the object
 *
 * obj->value = ...; // initializes the object
 *
 * tommy_trie_inplace_insert(&trie_inplace, &obj->node, obj, obj->value); // inserts the object
 * \endcode
 *
 * To find and element in the trie you have to call tommy_trie_inplace_search() providing
 * the key to search.
 *
 * \code
 * int value_to_find = 1;
 * struct object* obj = tommy_trie_inplace_search(&trie_inplace, value_to_find);
 * if (!obj) {
 *     // not found
 * } else {
 *     // found
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * To iterate over all the elements in the trie with the same key, you have to
 * use tommy_trie_inplace_bucket() and follow the tommy_node::next pointer until NULL.
 *
 * \code
 * int value_to_find = 1;
 * tommy_node* i = tommy_trie_inplace_bucket(&trie_inplace, value_to_find);
 * while (i) {
 *     struct object* obj = i->data; // gets the object pointer
 *
 *     printf("%d\n", obj->value); // process the object
 *
 *     i = i->next; // goes to the next element
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * To remove an element from the trie you have to call tommy_trie_inplace_remove()
 * providing the key to search and remove.
 *
 * \code
 * struct object* obj = tommy_trie_inplace_remove(&trie_inplace, value_to_remove);
 * if (obj) {
 *     free(obj); // frees the object allocated memory
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * To destroy the trie you have only to remove all the elements, as the trie is
 * completely inplace and it doesn't allocate memory.
 *
 * Note that you cannot iterate over all the elements in the trie using the
 * trie itself. You have to insert all the elements also in a ::tommy_list,
 * and use the list to iterate. See the \ref multiindex example for more detail.
